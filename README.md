# IterativeV2

An improved version of our previous iterative clustering algorithm, with faster runtimes and more flexibility.\

```
devtools::install_github("mikejdeines/IterativeV2")
```

Performs Leiden clustering (Traag, V. A. et al. Sci Rep 9, 5233 (2019)) iteratively on Seurat objects to identify all clusters with a significant number of differentially-expressed genes.
The gene scoring metric was adapted from Tasic, B. et al. Nat Neurosci 19, 335â€“346 (2016), with minor modifications for differential expression testing and simplified cutoffs.\

This package requires the use of igraph's implementation of the Leiden algorithm.\
To use this implementation, create a conda environment using reticulate and install numpy 1.24.4, igraph, and leidenalg.
```
library(reticulate)
conda_create(envname = "scrnaseq")
use_condaenv("scrnaseq")
py_install("numpy==1.24.4")
py_install("igraph")
py_install("leidenalg")
```
If a Seurat v5 object is being used, run JoinLayers() prior to clustering.
